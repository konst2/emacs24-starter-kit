From project to project some things may differ even in same language - 
different coding styles, separate auto-completion sources, etc. 
If you need to set some variables according to selected project, 
you can use standard Emacs feature called Per-Directory Local Variables. 
To use it you must create file named 

.dir-locals.el 

inside project directory. 
This file must contain something like this:

((nil . ((secret-ftp-password . "secret")
         (compile-command . "make target-x")
         (eval . (progn
                   (defun my-project-specific-function ()
                     ;; ...
                     ))))
 (c-mode . (c-file-style . "BSD")))
